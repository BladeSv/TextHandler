	Java provides the java.util.regex package for pattern matching with regular expressions. 
Java regular expressions are very similar to the Perl programming language and very easy to learn.
	A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or find other strings or sets of strings,
using a specialized syntax held in a pattern. They can be used to search, edit, or manipulate text and data.
	Capturing groups are a way to treat multiple characters as a single unit. They are created by placing the characters
to be grouped inside a set of parentheses. For example, the regular expression (dog) creates a single group containing
the letters "d", "o", and "g".
